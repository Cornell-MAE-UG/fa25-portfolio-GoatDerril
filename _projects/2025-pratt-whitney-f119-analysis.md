System: Jet Engine
A fan at the intake takes air into the engine, splitting it into two flows - one that goes directly into the compressor (core stream), and one that bypasses the compressor (bypass stream). Then, the core stream is put into a compressor and then mixed with fuel in a combustor, which adds chemical energy. The mix moves through a turbine to generate shaft work, which is in turn used to turn the fan at the intake. Then, the hot fluid is brought to a mixer to be brought together with the bypass stream, and sent out through a nozzle to produce thrust. 

Modifying system design:
In modern jet engines, most of the intake air is sent to the bypass stream rather than the core stream. These jet engines are called turbofans. Older jet engine designs actually had no bypass flow, and had intakes that took a lower mass of air straight through the core. These older designs were called turbojets, and since they did not use bypass flow, they did not have fans at the intake. The main difference between the two is that a turbofan gets most of its energy from the large volume of bypass air that moves relatively slowly through the engine, with the core air mostly being used to turn the turbine which powers the fan that allows for bypass flow. Only a small amount of the overall thrust of a turbofan comes from the fast moving core flow. A turbojet, one the other hand, takes in much less air, but moves it very fast, getting its energy from the high velocity air. 
Thermodynamically, the turbofan was found to be much more efficient overall (though the turbojet is not without its merits), specifically at low speeds. The reason for this is the kinetic energy of the larger mass of air leaving at a slow velocity out of a turbofan was much larger than the kinetic energy of the small mass of air leaving at a much higher velocity out of a turbojet for the same fuel consumption. This is ideal for commercial and cargo flights, where speed is much less of a concern than fuel consumption. However, at high speeds, a turbojet becomes more desirable, especially near or above Mach 1. Much of this stems from the large fan on a turbofan creating significant drag near the speed of sound, an issue which is not present in turbojets. In general, turbofans are more fuel efficient at lower speeds, and turbojets are more fuel efficient at higher speeds. In modern military aircraft, a turbofan is still used, but one that has a much smaller fan and bypasses much less air than commercial or cargo flights, thus allowing it to maintain decent efficiency at high and low speeds.

I’d like to specifically analyze an example of a turbofan, the Pratt & Whitney F119 (the engine of the F-22). As stated above, most military aircraft use a turbofan rather than a pure turbojet, but one that takes in much less air than commercial turbofans. 
The F119 provides 156 kN of thrust in afterburner, with 105 kN at intermediate power. It takes in air at around 118 kg/s, with a bypass ratio of ~0.3:1 (0.3 kg bypass air to 1 kg core air), far lower than the ~10:1 that commercial jet engines usually have. It has an overall pressure ratio of 26:1, a turbine inlet temperature of 1922 K, and a thrust to weight ratio of 5.2:1 (7.0:1 in afterburner). Fuel flow is only around 0.125 to 0.3 kg/s depending on whether the aircraft is in cruise or combat, significantly lower than the air flow. Using the generic turbofan diagram above, we can assume that m_a is around 118 kg/s, and at the split between hot and cold flows at the fan leads to an m_a_hot of 82.6 kg/s and m_a_cold of 35.4 kg/s. 
If we assume air entered the fan at 288 K, it must increase in temperature by 1634 K by the time it reaches the turbine. This means that the total energy added by the work done on the hot air by the fan and the compressor, as well as the heat added by the combustor (for the purpose of analysis, we will treat the chemical energy generated in the combustor as heat transfer into it) is equal to its change in enthalpy plus its change in kinetic energy. In the case of the energy accounted for by enthalpy, this can be calculated by C_p * (T_2 – T_1), where Cp for air is 1.005 kJ/(kg*K), which equals ~1642.17 kJ/kg. For a cold air flow of 82.6 kg/s, this is ~135643 kJ per second. 
Exact exit speeds of the mixed hot and cold air are not available publicly, but a good estimate based on other engines of its size would be ~700 m/s at normal power, and ~1100 m/s with afterburner. This would mean the total energy change of the air entering and exiting the engine would be its change in kinetic energy plus the hot air’s change in enthalpy and the cold air’s change in enthalpy from the fan compression it undergoes. The change in kinetic energy for normal flight, with a starting velocity of 515 m/s (roughly Mach 1.5) and an exit velocity of 700 m/s would be ~13261725 kJ/s. This is close to estimates for the energy output of the engine, though it does not include changes in enthalpy, so the value may be a bit higher. In terms of useful work output for moving the plane forward though, this value of 13.26 MW seems reasonable.

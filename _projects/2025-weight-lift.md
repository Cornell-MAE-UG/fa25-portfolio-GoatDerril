As part of a class project, I created a small design using three pins, a linear actuator of my choice, and one bar of any length I chose, in a design space of 150cm x 50cm. My approach to this problem was to pick a general design approach, which I chose to be the bar and actuator forming a relatively short triangle of sorts, and then creating equations and inequalities to act as the constraints on the starting position before force is applied. The reason for looking at the force and moment constraints at the start, and not later on, is that the moment of the actuator will increase and the moment of the weight at the top of the bar will decrease as the bar is raised, meaning the start of operation is the only time when force will be of concern. To give proper dimensions to my design, I picked reasonable values that fit all my constraints, and managed to lift the weight nearly 20 cm. To increase the effectiveness, one could solve the system of constraints created for an optimal solution.

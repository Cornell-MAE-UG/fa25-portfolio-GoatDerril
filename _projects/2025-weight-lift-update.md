This is an update to my prior work on the mechanism to lift a weight. To see the original work, please see this link:

This update's purpose is to take into account material properties, and requirements to ensure there is not too much bending in the rod. To do this, I used new knowledge of beam bending learned in my statics class to analyze the effects of the forces applied to the rod on its shape.
